# CSV Parser

I started this little side project to solve my problem with calculating and parsing CSV's fast for my businesses. I decided to create it with React.js to extend my knowledge with the framework.

### Installation

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

### TODO

1. Settings for parsed CSV.
2. Calculate total amount of a field.
